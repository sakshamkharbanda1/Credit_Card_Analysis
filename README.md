ðŸ’³ Credit Card Analysis with SQL & Power BI
This project focuses on analyzing credit card transaction data from the year 2023 using SQL and Power BI. The goal was to gain insights into customer behavior, revenue generation, and card usage patterns by creating interactive dashboards that break down the data in a clear and meaningful way.

Tools Used:
SQL: for extracting, cleaning, and transforming the raw transaction data.
Power BI: for building dynamic, interactive dashboards that make the data easier to understand and explore.

Project Overview:
The data was first prepared in SQL by me, where I performed various aggregations and filtering to get the dataset ready for analysis. Then, the cleaned dataset was brought into Power BI to create two separate dashboards:

~Card Metrics Dashboard
This dashboard presents key performance metrics related to different credit card categories (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum). It includes:
Total revenue and interest earned
Transaction modes (swipe, chip, online)
Revenue breakdown by education, occupation, and card type

~Customer Metrics Dashboard
This view focuses on customer profiles and behaviors, covering:
Revenue by age group, gender, and marital status
State-wise revenue distribution
Customer income levels and satisfaction scores
Average credit limit

~Key Insights:
Blue cards generated the highest revenue and interest.
Most transactions were done via swiping (over 60%).
Customers aged 60+ and those with higher income had the highest spending.
Texas, New York, and California led in state-wise revenue.
Graduates and businessmen were among the top contributors to revenue.

This project helped me practice how to connect backend SQL queries with front-end visuals in Power BI, while also learning how to find meaningful patterns in real-world financial data.
